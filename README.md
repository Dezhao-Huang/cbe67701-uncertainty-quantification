## Goals and Expectations

The overall goal of this reading group is to learn about uncertainty quantification with an eye to actual implementations and examples. We have a diverse classes with wide-ranging experiences and prior knowledge levels. Most people (including the instructors) will not fully appreciate and understand each sentence of each chapter. Instead, we recommend approaching each chapter with three questions in mind:
1. What are the overall concepts and how do they relate?
2. How could I apply one of these methods to a useful (engineering) problem?
3. What 1 or 2 clarifying questions should I ask in the class discussion to best advance my understanding of the two prior questions?

Everyone is expected to (attempt) to read each chapter and contribute at least one question per week on the class Google Doc (see Sakai for link). Moreover, each person is assigned one chapter to prepare an example.
